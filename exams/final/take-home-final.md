### **Task**: Scrape data from Goodreads.com üìö

---

### **Objective**
For this exam, you will scrape and analyze data from Goodreads.com. The work is split into two parts, each focusing on different aspects of the data
1. **"Best Books" Analysis**: Explore Goodreads' "Best Books" lists for a specific year.
2. **Author-Level Analysis**: Study the trends and patterns in the works of a specific author.

### **Instructions**

#### **Task 1: Best Books**
You are tasked with analyzing Goodreads' "Best Books" lists for a specific year based on the **first letter of your first name**. For example, if your first name starts with **A‚ÄìE**, you are assigned to the year **2023**; if it starts with **F‚ÄìJ**, you are assigned to **2022**, and so on:

| Initials | Assigned Year | URL                                              |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| A‚ÄìE      | 2023          | [Best Books of 2023](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2023) |
| F‚ÄìJ      | 2022          | [Best Books of 2022](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2022) |
| K‚ÄìO      | 2021          | [Best Books of 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2021) |
| P‚ÄìT      | 2020          | [Best Books of 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2020) |
| U‚ÄìZ      | 2019          | [Best Books of 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2019) |



**Your Tasks**:
1. Scrape data from the Goodreads "Best Books of [Year]" list:
   - **URL**: https://www.goodreads.com/list/best_of_year/2023 (replace the year with your assigned year). You can also use the table above.
2. Collect the following data for each book:
   - Title
   - Publication date (first published)
   - Author
   - Genre (if available, and feel free to pick the first genre listed)
   - Average rating
   - Number of ratings
   - Number of pages
   - Rank
   - Language (if available)
   - Number of people who are currently reading (if available)
   - Number of people who want to read (if available)
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - **Genre ratings**:
       - Compare average ratings across genres. Which 2-3 genres tends to have the highest ratings? Create a table showing average rating score, and average rank by genre.
   - **Popularity and ratings**:
       - Examine whether books with more ratings tend to have higher or lower average scores. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between the number of ratings and average rating. On the x-axis, you should have **number of ratings**; on the y-axis, you should have **average rating**.

#### **Task 2: Author-Level Analysis**
You are now tasked with analyzing books by a specific author based on the **first letter of your first name**:

| Your first name initial | Author              | Author Goodreads link                               | Birthday       |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| A‚ÄìE      | Stephen King        | [Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/3389)         | Sep 21, 1947   |

| P‚ÄìT      | Neil Gaiman         | [Neil Gaiman](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1221698)       | Nov 10, 1960   |
| U‚ÄìZ      | Nora Roberts        | [Nora Roberts](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/625)          | Oct 10, 1950   |


**Your Tasks**:
1. Scrape all books by your assigned author:
   - Use the link provided for your author.
2. Collect the following data for each book:
   - Title
   - Publication date (first published)
   - Author
   - Genre (if available, and feel free to pick the first genre listed)
   - Average rating
   - Number of ratings
   - Number of pages
   - Rank (from the books written by the author)
   - Language (if available)
   - Number of people who are currently reading (if available)
   - Number of people who want to read (if available)
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - **Language Distribution**:
     - How many books has the author published in English? In other languages? Create a table showing the count of books by language.
   - **Author's Age and Page Count**:
     - Do authors tend to write longer books as they age? Use the author's birthday to calculate their age at the time of each book's publication. Create a line plot with **author's age** on the x-axis and **page count** on the y-axis.
   - **Author's Age and Rating**:
     - For English-only books, create a line plot with **author's age** on the x-axis and **average rating** on the y-axis.
     - Repeat the analysis including books in languages other than English. Does your interpretation change?
   - **Pages vs. Ratings**:
     - Is there a relationship between the number of pages and a book's average rating? Create a scatterplot with **page count** on the x-axis and **average rating** on the y-axis.
   - **Interest on a book**:
     - Is there a relationship between the number of people who are currently reading the book and the number of people who left a rating? Create a scatterplot with **number of people who are currently reading** on the x-axis and **number of ratings** on the y-axis. Create a second scatterplot with **average rating** on the y-axis. Do books with more interest tend to receive higher ratings?

### **Tips**
- Make sure to insert time.sleep() right after you request driver to go to a link (before requesting elements). Make sure to wait at least 0.7 second, or even slightly higher if you run into issues.
- Try-except blocks will be your friend because xpath positions on a page may differ depending on the book and content availability.
