    "Your assignment is to write your own \"story\" where your story includes an event where its details could be traced in a relational database, much like the SQL Murder Mystery's story. Please feel free to be creative! After you turn in your WiD assignment, I will give you my feedback, and you will resubmit an updated version which then will be included in your WiD portfolio. Note that you have to complete this assignment even if you are not a Data Analytics Major. Please make sure your story is around 500 words. Feel free to use a relational database schema you construct \"by hand\". Good luck, and I look forward to reading your stories!"
